      <p>My favourite hobby is doing art. Whenever I'm free, or stressed from school, I always sketch or paint. It never fails to calm me down. I have been doing art since I was very young, and when I am older, I would love to get into art school. Art helps in gaining many virtues, like patience, and you can also unleash your creativity. It is truly very important in life.</p>
